# CS345-Final_CalculatorProject

**Short description:** A small calculator application. The calculator is intended to minimize the number of buttons, while also incorporating gestures for various functions, such as:
-	[x] Equals: swipe up
-	[x] Add: swipe right
-	[x] Subtract swipe left
-	[x] Clear: swipe down

There will also be a “history” display option that allows the user to view previously entered calculations, as usually seen with standard graphing calculators.

**How to fulfill 9 criteria:**
1.	Images, including an app icon:
-	[x] A calculator app icon
-	[x] A calculator logo incorporated within the main menu
2.	A minimum of 3 interfaces (which are controlled by separate view controllers):
-	[x] A basic main menu interface that is displayed when the user opens the app. This will display the option to either perform calculations or to view previous calculation data.
-	[x] A calculation display that will show the output, the buttons for the numbers, and a little “touchpad” area that allows the user to interact with by using gestures to perform the calculation functions.
-	[x] An interface that shows the previous calculations that have been performed. There is the option to clear the data, otherwise the data should be persistent when the app is terminated.
-	[x] An interface that allows one to view and add common formulas. This is also persistent.
3.	At least two different gestures:
-	[x] Equals: swipe up
-	[x] Add: swipe right
-	[x] Subtract swipe left
-	[x] Clear: swipe down
-	[x] Tap: return back to the main menu
4.	At least one animation:
-	[ ] Sliding animations that are utilized when switching to different interfaces
5.	At least one alert:
-	[x] When clicking on formula cell in tableView, an alert will pop up explaining how to implement the formula
6.	You must obtain text input from the user via a text-field (which may be included in the alert):
-	[X] When adding formulas, an alert pops up to notify the user to enter the formula within a text-field.
7.	You must save some part of the state of your app when the app is terminated and restore it the next time the app is launched:
-	[X] Previous calculation data will be saved
-	[x] Common formulas will be saved
8.	You must have at least one of the following views:
-	[x] Table view
-	[X] Scroll view
      -	[X] The formula interface will be pre-populated with enough formulas to allow a scroll view to work.
9.	You must have at least one of the following views:
-	[X] Button
      -	[X] Used to navigate to different interfaces
      -	[X] Used to choose the numbers that are desired for input
-	[ ] Slider
-	[ ] Picker
